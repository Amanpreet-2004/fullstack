we can declare varibales in three types 

i)let : block scope, can not be redeclared  it can be reasign



ii)const : block,     can not be redeclared  it can not be reasign


iii)var : it can be global scope, function, can can be redeclared

{
      ...this is a block
}

lexical scope:  we can access the value of a varibale inside there inner child block and the scope of parent upto which it can be accsesd is known as lexical scope

{
    {
        let a=8
        {
            we can access a in this
        }
    }
    .
    .
    .
    {



    }
}
