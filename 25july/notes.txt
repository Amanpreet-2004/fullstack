SPREAD OPEARATOR AND REST OPEARATOR



//SPREAD:  MEANS SPREADING THINGS WHICH ARE TOGETHER
   syntax :  ...obj,   ...arr,...str

   iterable elements: those data in whihc we can access value one by one
      like arr=[1,2,3,4,5]
      like string "qwertyuiop"  

  spread operator works on iterable objects means array,string...and so on

//REST : 

    rest operator syntax is same as spread operator  ...obj,...arr, or ony iterable data type

    it is used to collect multiple elements into an sigle data type

    let sum=0;
    for(num of array){     //syntax to iterate without indexing
        sum=sum+num;
    }

    return sum
