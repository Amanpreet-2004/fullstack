LEXICAL SCOPE  : COMBINATION OF BLOCK +INNER +OUTER SCOPE

***CLOSURE***

closure are property of functions to remember the varible defined in its outer SCOPE

even when the inner functions is called outside the main body of outerfunction

if there is duplicacy in varible then it will access the value of the closeset scope varible




localstorage :  is used to store the value in key : value   (both key and value should be in string tyep)
